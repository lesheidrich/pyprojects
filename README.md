# pyprojects
A collection of Python practice projects categorized by difficulty and appended with notes of personal development.

BEGINNER PROJECTS:
------------------
* leap_year_app.py ==> great simple calculation app utilizing logic, functions and proper use of looping for the sake of continuous a ui
* Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock.py ==> basic program with heavy use of logical operators in if-else functions, made for future tkinter project...and because I wanted to :)
* Caesarian_Cipher.py ==> useful modification in direction of function output through parameters and recycled arguments, good use of modulus for continued array looping
